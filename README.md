### Estimate story points strategy
#### Since this project is not something which will take a long time, the effort or man hours point could not be implemented. I decided that the simplest task, which is the first taks in the below table to represent 1 point and all other tasks points to be relative to that one. Fibonacci sequence: 1,2,3,5,8 will be used as a sequence when story points are determened.
---

ID | Task | Justification | Story Points 
--- |--- | --- | ---
1 | **As a developer I want to create the CONSTANTS class** | **So that duplication of code can be avoided** | `1`
2 | **As a developer I want to create the class models** | **So that different actions can be performed** | `2`
3 | **As a developer I want to create the custom exception classes** | **So that I can use them for all kind of validations** | `2`
3 | **As a developer I want to create the method which create a new Rubric** | **So that each grad is associated to a Rubric** | `1`
