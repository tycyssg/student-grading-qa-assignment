### Estimate story points strategy
#### Since this project is not something which will take a long time, the effort or man hours point could not be implemented. I decided that the simplest task, which is the first taks in the below table to represent 1 point and all other tasks points to be relative to that one. Fibonacci sequence: 1,2,3,5,8 will be used as a sequence when story points are determened.
---

ID | Task | Justification | Story Points 
--- |--- | --- | ---
1 | **As a developer I want to create the CONSTANTS class** | **So that duplication of code can be avoided** | `1`
2 | **As a developer I want to create the class models** | **So that different actions can be performed** | `2`
3 | **As a developer I want to create the custom exception classes** | **So that I can use them for all kind of validations** | `2`
4 | **As a developer I want to create the method which create a new Rubric** | **So that application flow can start** | `1`
5 | **As a developer I want to create the methods which gets a all existing Rubrics and get a single Rubric by name** | **N/A** | `2`
6 | **As a developer I want to create the method that add a criteria to a Rubric** | **So that Rubric criteria can be populated** | `1`
7 | **As a developer I want to create the method that add a student grade to a Rubric** | **So that Rubric student scores can be populated** | `1`
8 | **As a developer I want to create the method that get the grade of a Rubric for a specific Student** | **So that the user can get the grade of a student** | `2`
9 | **As a developer I want to create the methods that get the Min and Max grade of a Rubric** | **So that the user can check these details** | `5`
10 | **As a developer I want to create the method that get standard deviation grade of a Rubric** | **So that the user can check these details** | `3`
11 | **As a developer I want to create the methods that get the Min and Max score from a Student grade** | **So that the user can check these details** | `3`
12 | **As a developer I want to create the methods that get the Standard Deviation score from a Student grade** | **So that the user can check these details** | `2`
13 | **As a developer I want to create the method that get avg grade of a Rubric** | **So that the user can check these details** | `2`
14 | **As a developer I want to create the class that which run all the tasks** | **N/A** | `2`
